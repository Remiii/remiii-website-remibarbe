Meeting (SaturdayÂ : 18h15) on GUPnP at FOSDEM.  
Zeeshan will briefly explain what UPnP is all about, followed by an introduction to GUPnP API with special emphasis on the server-side API.  
He will also explain how it is so easy to implement your own UPnP devices using GUPnP with the help of an example Light Bulb device that implements two simple services. I will also explain why GUPnP deserves to be the default UPnP stack on maemo and GNOME platforms.
